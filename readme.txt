TimePad Events for WordPress is the easiest way to start selling tickets on your site using the full stack of TimePad technologies.

== Description ==

TimePad Events for WordPress is the easiest way to start selling tickets on your site using the full stack of TimePad technologies.

After installing the plugin and connecting your TimePad account you're gonna be able to:

* Automatically publish the events you create in TimePad, on your site. You won't have to transfer the events descriptions and formatting manually, paste the registration forms and break your events down into categories. A newly created event will automatically appear on your site, right where you want it.

* A full-feature registration and ticket selling form will appear automatically in every published event. You don't have to paste it manually or customize your theme's templates: the TimePad Events plugin is compatible with any third-party theme or plugin for WordPress.

* The list of your events will be available right in your WordPress admin area. If you need to change or edit your event, the plugin will redirect you straight to the appropriate page in your TimePad account.

If you're a site developer or have your own WordPress plugin or theme, the TimePad Events plugin will provide a convenient toolset for ticket selling forms integration. Just install the shortcode `[timepadregistration eventid="123"]` where you need it, and TimePad Events will do the rest.
